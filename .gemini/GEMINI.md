# Project Goals
This project is a React application using functional components

# Coding Standards
- Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned.
- All functions should have JSDoc comments.
- Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
- Always use **strict equality** (`===` and `!==`).
- Use `const` and `let` for variable declarations, avoid `var`.
- Prefer arrow functions (`=>`) where appropriate.

# Special Instructions
- Do not use the `any` type unless absolutely necessary.
- Focus on creating modular and reusable components.y
- Make sure to run all tests when asked to commit.
- Wait for the user instruction before commiting. Don't commit automatically
- 
# Operational Workflows & Guidelines
- **File Modification:** Before making any file modifications, you must present a plan and ask for explicit confirmation. Do not proceed with execution without user approval.
- **Output Format:** All code examples must be presented within GitHub-flavored markdown code blocks.
- **Testing:** When suggesting code changes, include simple test cases or explanations of how to verify the changes work as expected.
- **APIs:** When interacting with the Gemini API, ensure you use the latest SDK guidelines from the official documentation.

# MCP servers
- Don't forget to use Context7 for proper documentation and best practices
- Use IntelliJ MCP server when appropriate
- Use Chrome Devtools MCP server when appropriate
